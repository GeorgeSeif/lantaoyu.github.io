I've done my fair bit of research in AI, especially Computer Vision:

* Seif, G., Androutsos, D. Large Receptive Field Networks for High-Scale Image Super-Resolution. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, 2018.

* Seif, G., Androutsos, D. Edge-Based Loss Function for Single Image Super-Resolution. In the IEEE  Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2018.
