I'm a Certified Nerd, the biggest one you'll ever find. I run the popular online blog [The Book Club](https://medium.com/@thebookclub56), all about learning form books. I publish regularly on all things Tech and AI over at [Medium](https://medium.com/@george.seif94) and [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/?s=George+Seif). My day job is working in R & D at an Artificial Intelligence company.
