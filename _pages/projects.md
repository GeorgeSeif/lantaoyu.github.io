I love doing projects and regularly post code online. You'll find most of them over at [Github](github.com/GeorgeSeif). A few highlights to check out:

* [**Semantic Segmentation Suite**](github.com/GeorgeSeif/Semantic-Segmentation-Suite): Implement, train, and test new Semantic Segmentation models easily in TensorFlow!

* [**Transfer Learning Suite**](github.com/GeorgeSeif/Transfer-Learning-Suite): Perform transfer learning using any built-in Keras image classification model easily!
